# Processing and visualising Hong Kong government open data with Elasticsearch, Kibana and Timelion

In this workshop, we will explore creating a mock data processing
pipeline using open data from the Hong Kong government.

What this workshop hopes to show you is how easily you can get up and
running with the Elastic stack and visualise and explore your data in
real-time. Ultimately this workshop should provide you the foundations
to expand the example pipeline for your own data or other open source
data you find.
